# app-code-design

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements and goals of the app I developed was to create an inventory app that allowed for users to be able to create their own account and use SQLLite.
This app was designed to meet the user needs of an application that users could store information if they they had inventory to keep track of. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A Login screen was necessary, the inventory screen was necessary as well and finally a notification screen where users can set their preference of recieving SMS notifications. 
My UI design kep users in mind by creating a sleek design where users could input their information right after signing in and keeping everything simple with few buttons making the user happy. My design was successful because it was effective and kept a professional appearance. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached designing the application in weekly sprints working on speciic pages and styling and working on the funtions accordingly. I can apply these skills in the future working on a team project adding features to an ongoing project and ensuring each design meets specific standards before comitting changes. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested each time code was changed and made sure I commented a lot and this is important because each change can have a large impact on your application. Testing revealed when buttons didn't function as intended and helped make sure the application was designed efficiently. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I had to innovate to overcome the challenge of learning how to implement SMS notifications and I overcame this challenge by doing a lot of research and even asking AI for reference on parts of code I designed and what may be wrong with my design. I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge with the Login Screen of the application, I was able to implement a database that kept users information and where new users could store their new accounts. I was proud of my experience being able to design that element of the application and even the inventory part of the app with the add and remove buttons for inventory.
